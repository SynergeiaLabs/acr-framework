# ACR Control Plane

**A runtime control plane for AI agents that take real actions.**

This is the reference control plane for the [ACR Framework](https://github.com/SynergeiaLabs/acr-framework): a governance gateway that sits between autonomous agents and the systems they want to touch.

If agents are going to reach customer data, ticketing systems, production infrastructure, payment flows, or regulated workflows, then logs and prompt rules are not enough. You need a real enforcement point on the execution path.

This repo is that reference implementation.

## Why This Exists

Most agent stacks are optimized for capability:
- better planning
- better tool use
- better memory
- better autonomy

Most are not optimized for control.

That leaves a dangerous gap:
- agents can act faster than humans can review
- prompts and app logic are weak enforcement boundaries
- direct tool access can bypass governance entirely
- security teams often get telemetry after the fact instead of a hard stop before execution

The ACR Control Plane closes that gap with:
- identity binding
- policy enforcement
- approval workflows
- drift detection
- kill-switch containment
- forensic evidence export

## What It Proves

Every agent action request flows through a governed decision pipeline before it is allowed, denied, or escalated.

```text
Agent Runtime
    |
    v
ACR Gateway
    |
    +--> Identity and purpose binding
    +--> Behavioral policy enforcement
    +--> Output controls
    +--> Telemetry and evidence
    +--> Drift detection
    +--> Human approval
    +--> Kill switch containment
    |
    v
Allowed enterprise action
```

This gives you a hard boundary between:
- what an agent wants to do
- what your organization is willing to let it do

The repo now demonstrates four proof points that matter to real adopters:
- runtime policy decisions on the hot path
- bypass-resistant downstream execution with payload-bound authorization
- gateway-minted short-lived brokered credentials for executors
- security and secret-management guardrails around the control plane itself

## Why It’s Different

Most "agent governance" products stop at dashboards, evals, or prompt wrappers.

This project is opinionated in a more operational way:
- **Fail-secure by default.** If a critical dependency breaks, the safe answer is deny.
- **Policy as code.** Enforcement is not trapped in prompts or UI rules. It lives in versioned OPA/Rego policy.
- **Runtime-first.** This is designed for live action requests, not just offline evaluation.
- **Operator-ready.** There is a console for approvals, keys, policy drafting, release activation, drift inspection, and containment actions.
- **Forensics included.** Evidence bundles can be exported per correlation ID with manifest, events, and checksums.
- **Bypass-aware.** Downstream executors can verify short-lived gateway authorization and brokered credentials before they run anything.
- **Enterprise-shaped.** JWTs, OIDC-ready operator auth, API keys, Redis, Postgres, OPA, OpenTelemetry, Docker, Kubernetes manifests.

## The Six Control Pillars

| Pillar | Control | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Identity and Purpose Binding | Ensures the caller is a registered agent operating within declared purpose and boundaries |
| 2 | Behavioral Policy Enforcement | Applies allow, deny, and escalate logic before execution |
| 3 | Autonomy Drift Detection | Detects behavior deviating from expected baselines |
| 4 | Execution Observability | Captures decision telemetry, traces, and evidence |
| 5 | Self-Healing and Containment | Supports kill-switch and graduated response patterns |
| 6 | Human Authority | Routes risky actions into approvals, overrides, and SLA-backed review |

## What You Can Demo In Minutes

With the included stack, you can:
- register an agent
- issue a short-lived JWT
- evaluate allowed and forbidden tool calls
- trigger approval escalation for risky actions
- inspect telemetry in the operator console
- generate policy drafts and publish policy releases
- activate a live bundle alias for OPA discovery
- export evidence for a single run

The included sample agent shows the control plane denying unsafe actions and escalating high-risk ones.

There is also a runnable [protected executor example](examples/protected_executor/README.md) that verifies both `X-ACR-Execution-Token` and `X-ACR-Brokered-Credential`, so downstream services can reject direct-bypass requests that were not explicitly authorized by the gateway.

For workflow builders and orchestration tools, there is now an explicit [orchestrator integration guide](docs/orchestrators.md) plus an [n8n reference example](examples/n8n/README.md) showing how to put ACR underneath the workflow layer instead of relying on optional user behavior.

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the stack

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up --build
```

Services:

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `acr-gateway` | `8000` | Main control plane |
| `acr-killswitch` | `8443` | Independent containment service |
| `opa` | `8181` | Policy engine |
| `postgres` | `5432` | Persistent state |
| `redis` | `6379` | cache, rate limits, coordination |

### 2. Verify health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/acr/health
```

Expected:

```json
{"status":"healthy","version":"1.0","env":"development"}
```

### 3. Open the operator console

Visit [http://localhost:8000/console](http://localhost:8000/console)

Use:
- Operator API key: `dev-operator-key`
- Kill switch secret: `killswitch_dev_secret_change_me`

Inside the console you can:
- create and rotate operator keys
- register and manage agents
- draft policy packages
- simulate policy decisions
- publish and activate releases
- review approvals
- inspect events and drift
- trigger containment

### 4. Run the sample agent

```bash
pip install httpx
export ACR_OPERATOR_API_KEY=dev-operator-key
python examples/sample_agent/agent.py
```

The sample flow demonstrates:
1. agent registration
2. normal allowed actions
3. denied dangerous actions
4. escalated high-risk actions

## Core API Surface

Full API docs live in [docs/api.md](docs/api.md).
Operational adoption guidance for workflow tools lives in [docs/orchestrators.md](docs/orchestrators.md).

The main endpoints are:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/acr/evaluate` | Evaluate an agent action request |
| `POST` | `/acr/agents` | Register a new agent |
| `POST` | `/acr/agents/{agent_id}/token` | Issue an agent JWT |
| `GET` | `/acr/approvals` | Review pending approvals |
| `GET` | `/acr/events` | Query telemetry events |
| `GET` | `/acr/evidence/{correlation_id}` | Export a run evidence bundle |
| `GET` | `/acr/drift/{agent_id}` | Inspect drift posture |
| `POST` | `/acr/containment/kill` | Trigger containment |

## Security Posture

This repo is designed around the assumption that agent systems eventually become high-impact systems.

That shows up in the implementation:
- operator endpoints require authenticated access
- docs and console can be gated outside development
- readiness responses can be sanitized for non-sensitive status output
- JWT issuance is rate-limited
- secrets are rejected in non-development environments if they are weak defaults
- production secret generation and CI secret-hygiene checks are included
- policy distribution is separated from operator control surfaces
- downstream executors can require short-lived gateway-issued execution authorization tied to the exact payload
- downstream executors can require short-lived brokered credentials with audience and scope claims
- evidence export supports incident response and auditability

## Enterprise Roadmap

The next hardening steps are tracked in [docs/enterprise-roadmap.md](docs/enterprise-roadmap.md).

Current highlights:
- bypass-resistant downstream execution is implemented as a reference pattern
- the repo includes a dedicated security workflow for CodeQL, Semgrep, Gitleaks, Trivy, and SBOM generation
- production secret generation and secret-hygiene checks are in place
- brokered downstream credential minting is implemented
- the next major gap is reliability semantics under dependency failure

## Architecture

```text

  | POST /acr/evaluate
  v
ACR Control Plane
  |
  +--> Pillar 1: Identity
  +--> Pillar 2: Policy
  +--> Pillar 3: Drift
  +--> Pillar 4: Observability

```

Target synchronous path:

```text
Identity -> Policy -> Output controls -> Response
```

Background tasks handle telemetry persistence, drift work, and approval lifecycle without bloating the hot path.

## Local Development

### Install

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Generate production secrets

```bash
python scripts/generate_secrets.py > .env.production
```

Use `.env.production.example` as the non-dev template and store the generated values in your secret manager rather than committing them.

### Run tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/acr --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Run without the full Docker stack

```bash
docker-compose up postgres redis opa acr-killswitch

DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://acr:acr_dev_password@localhost:5432/acr_control_plane \
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0 \
OPA_URL=http://localhost:8181 \
KILLSWITCH_URL=http://localhost:8443 \
OPERATOR_API_KEYS_JSON='{"dev-operator-key":{"subject":"dev-operator","roles":["agent_admin","approver","security_admin","auditor","killswitch_operator"]}}' \
SERVICE_OPERATOR_API_KEY=dev-operator-key \
uvicorn acr.main:app --reload
```

### Test policies

```bash
opa test policies/ -v
```

## Who This Is For

This is a strong fit if you are:
- building agentic products that can take actions, not just answer questions
- trying to get security, compliance, and platform teams aligned on one control layer
- experimenting with human-in-the-loop approval for risky workflows
- looking for a real reference architecture for AI runtime governance

## If You’re Evaluating It Internally

Start with this question:

**If one of your agents tried to refund money, delete records, exfiltrate data, or hit a sensitive internal API right now, where would the hard stop actually live?**

If the answer is "the prompt," "the app code," or "we’d catch it in logs," this project will probably feel uncomfortably relevant.
