# ACR Runtime Architecture

The ACR Framework operates as a runtime governance control layer positioned between autonomous AI systems and enterprise infrastructure.

Its purpose is to ensure that governance policies remain enforceable while AI systems operate in production environments.

Traditional AI governance models focus primarily on development-time controls such as model approval workflows, documentation, and policy definition. The ACR Framework extends governance into runtime by introducing mechanisms that constrain, observe, and, when necessary, intervene in AI system behavior.

# Architectural Role of ACR
![ACR Framework](../images/acr-reference-architecture.png)

ACR functions as a control plane that mediates interactions between autonomous AI systems and enterprise resources.

## Reference Architecture
---

By operating at this layer, ACR ensures that governance policies can be enforced during execution rather than only during development or deployment.

---

# Core Runtime Governance Functions

The ACR Runtime Architecture enforces six governance functions:

1. Identity & Purpose Binding  
2. Behavioral Policy Enforcement  
3. Autonomy Drift Detection  
4. Execution Observability  
5. Self-Healing & Containment  
6. Human Authority  

Together these functions enable organizations to maintain operational control over increasingly autonomous AI systems.

---

# Runtime Control Flow

A typical ACR-governed execution flow operates as follows:

1. An AI system receives an input, request, or task.
2. ACR validates the system identity and defined operational purpose.
3. ACR evaluates whether the requested action is permitted under governance policy.
4. The AI system executes within approved constraints.
5. ACR records execution activity for observability and audit.
6. ACR continuously monitors for abnormal behavior or autonomy drift.
7. If necessary, ACR restricts, interrupts, or escalates the activity.

This control flow ensures that governance policies remain active throughout system operation.

# Architectural Components

## Identity & Purpose Binding Layer

This layer establishes the authorized identity, operational role, and governance scope of an AI system.

It defines:

- system purpose
- authorized data sources
- approved tools
- operational boundaries

This ensures that AI systems cannot operate outside their intended domain.

---

## Behavioral Policy Enforcement Layer

This layer translates governance policy into enforceable runtime controls.

Examples include:

- restricting access to sensitive data
- limiting tool invocation
- enforcing workflow boundaries
- preventing disallowed output behavior

This layer ensures that governance policies are actively enforced during system operation.

---

## Autonomy Drift Detection Layer

AI systems may gradually diverge from their intended operational boundaries as prompts change, workflows expand, or tools are introduced.

Autonomy Drift Detection monitors system behavior to identify:

- expanded tool usage
- altered execution patterns
- abnormal interaction sequences
- unexpected operational scope

Early detection allows organizations to intervene before risk escalates.

---

## Execution Observability Layer

Execution Observability provides visibility into AI system behavior during runtime.

This includes recording:

- task inputs
- system actions
- outputs
- interactions with enterprise systems

Observability enables investigation, audit, and governance review.

---

## Self-Healing & Containment Layer

When abnormal or unsafe behavior is detected, containment mechanisms can limit impact.

Examples include:

- restricting system capabilities
- interrupting workflows
- isolating AI processes
- escalating events for human review

These mechanisms reduce operational risk and help restore safe system behavior.

---

## Human Authority Layer

Autonomous AI systems must remain subject to human oversight.

This layer ensures that organizations maintain the ability to:

- intervene in AI system operations
- override automated decisions
- require human approval for high-risk actions
- suspend or terminate AI execution

Human authority remains the final governance control.

---

# Operational Outcomes

When implemented effectively, the ACR Runtime Architecture enables organizations to:

- enforce governance policies during AI execution
- constrain autonomous behavior to defined boundaries
- detect abnormal system activity
- generate audit-ready execution records
- maintain human oversight of autonomous systems

---

# Applicability

The ACR Runtime Architecture is applicable to a range of AI-driven systems, including:

- enterprise AI copilots
- autonomous agents
- workflow automation systems
- decision-support AI
- AI systems with tool access
- multi-step reasoning and orchestration systems

It is particularly relevant where AI systems interact with enterprise data, operational infrastructure, or critical workflows.

---

# Summary

The ACR Runtime Architecture extends AI governance from policy into production control.

By introducing a runtime governance layer between autonomous AI systems and enterprise infrastructure, the ACR Framework enables organizations to monitor, constrain, and intervene in AI behavior while systems are actively running.

This architecture provides the operational foundation required to govern increasingly autonomous AI systems in enterprise environments.
