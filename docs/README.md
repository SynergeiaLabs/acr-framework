# ACR Framework Documentation

This directory contains the full ACR (Autonomous Control & Resilience) Framework documentation—a reference architecture for governing autonomous AI systems at runtime.

## Get Started by Role

Choose a path based on your role. Each path is 3–5 steps to the most relevant docs.

| Role | Goal | Path |
|------|------|------|
| **Architect** | Design runtime governance into your AI systems | [Control Plane Architecture](architecture/acr-control-plane-architecture.md) → [Runtime Architecture](architecture/acr-runtime-architecture.md) → [Implementation Guide](guides/acr-implementation-guide.md) → [Telemetry Schema](specifications/telemetry-schema.md) |
| **Security** | Understand threats and controls | [STRIKE Threat Model](security/acr-strike-threat-model.md) → [Behavioral Policy Enforcement](pillars/02-behavioral-policy-enforcement.md) → [Self-Healing & Containment](pillars/05-self-healing-containment.md) → [Identity & Purpose Binding](pillars/01-identity-purpose-binding.md) |
| **Compliance** | Map ACR to frameworks and audits | [NIST AI RMF Mapping](compliance/acr-nist-ai-rmf-mapping.md) → [Execution Observability](pillars/04-execution-observability.md) → [Human Authority](pillars/06-human-authority.md) → [SOC 2 / ISO placeholders](compliance/) |
| **Implementer** | Build or integrate ACR-aligned controls | [Implementation Guide](guides/acr-implementation-guide.md) → [Use Cases](guides/acr-use-cases.md) → [Telemetry Schema](specifications/telemetry-schema.md) → [Pillars](pillars/README.md) |
| **Evaluator** | Assess adoption or vendor alignment | [Adoption & Maturity](../ADOPTION.md) → [Pillars Overview](pillars/README.md) → [STRIKE Summary](security/acr-strike-threat-model.md#strike-summary-matrix) |
