# Identity & Purpose Binding Specification

**ACR Control Layer 1 of 6**

## Purpose

Establish and enforce the operational identity and authorized scope of each AI system, ensuring systems cannot operate outside their intended domain without explicit authorization.

## Control Objectives

1. **Cryptographic Identity Binding:** Every AI system operates with a verifiable, cryptographically-bound identity
2. **Purpose Scoping:** System capabilities are constrained to specific business functions
3. **Resource Authorization:** Access to data sources and tools requires explicit grants
4. **Operational Boundaries:** Geographic, temporal, and domain constraints are enforced
5. **Scope Expansion Control:** Capability additions require approval and re-binding

## Scope

### In Scope
- Service identity establishment and verification
- Purpose-based capability authorization
- Resource access control list management
- Operational boundary enforcement
- Identity lifecycle management (creation, rotation, revocation)

### Out of Scope
- Individual user authentication (handled by application layer)
- Network-level access controls (handled by infrastructure)
- Model training authentication (pre-deployment concern)
- End-user authorization (application responsibility)

## Architectural Patterns

### Pattern 1: Service Identity Tokens

**Mechanism:** Cryptographic tokens bind AI systems to identities

**Technologies:**
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with signed claims
- SPIFFE/SPIRE for workload identity
- x.509 certificates for mutual TLS
- OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow

**Implementation approach:**
```
1. AI system requests token from identity provider
2. Identity provider issues short-lived token with claims:
   - agent_id: unique identifier
   - purpose: authorized business function
   - authorized_resources: data sources, APIs, tools
   - valid_until: token expiration
   - issuer: identity authority
3. AI system presents token with each operation
4. Control plane validates token signature and claims
5. Operations outside authorized scope are denied
```

**Design considerations:**
- Token lifetime: Balance security (short) vs. performance (long)
- Rotation strategy: Automated renewal before expiration
- Revocation mechanism: Blacklist or short TTL approach
- Claim granularity: Coarse (simple) vs. fine (complex but precise)

### Pattern 2: Purpose-Based RBAC

**Mechanism:** Role assignments encode operational purposes

**Technologies:**
- Traditional RBAC with purpose-defined roles
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) with purpose attributes
- Policy-as-code (OPA, Cedar) with purpose predicates

**Implementation approach:**
```
1. Define purposes as first-class entities:
   - customer_support
   - data_analysis
   - code_review
   - document_processing

2. Map purposes to capabilities:
   purpose: customer_support
     data_read: [customer_db, ticket_history]
     data_write: [ticket_updates]
     tools: [send_email, create_ticket]
     forbidden: [delete_customer, refund_transaction]

3. Assign AI system to purpose at deployment
4. Control plane evaluates purpose + requested action
5. Deny actions not authorized for purpose
```

**Design considerations:**
- Purpose taxonomy: Standardized vs. organization-specific
- Granularity: Coarse purposes (easy to manage) vs. fine (better control)
- Inheritance: Can purposes inherit from others?
- Conflict resolution: What happens when purpose changes?

### Pattern 3: Capability Authorization Matrices

**Mechanism:** Explicit allow/deny tables for each AI system

**Technologies:**
- Database-backed authorization tables
- Policy engines with decision caching
- API gateway authorization plugins

**Implementation approach:**
```
Authorization Matrix for agent_id: customer-support-001

| Resource Type | Resource ID | Permission | Granted |
|---------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Database | customer_db | READ | YES |
| Database | customer_db | WRITE | NO |
| API | send_email | INVOKE | YES |
| API | delete_account | INVOKE | NO |
| Tool | query_billing | EXECUTE | YES |
| Tool | issue_refund | EXECUTE | NO |

Control plane checks matrix on every resource access attempt.
```

**Design considerations:**
- Matrix size: Can grow large for complex systems
- Performance: Caching strategy critical
- Updates: How to modify matrix without downtime
- Audit trail: Log all matrix modifications

### Pattern 4: Resource Access Control Lists

**Mechanism:** Data sources maintain allow-lists of authorized AI systems

**Technologies:**
- Database user permissions
- API key scoping
- Cloud IAM policies (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Network policies (Kubernetes NetworkPolicy)

**Implementation approach:**
```
Resource: production_customer_database

Authorized AI Systems:
- customer-support-agent-01 (READ only)
- data-analyst-agent-03 (READ only, anonymized views)
- billing-automation-agent-07 (READ + WRITE, billing tables only)

Denied by default: All other AI systems

Enforcement point: Database proxy or API gateway
```

**Design considerations:**
- Centralized vs. distributed ACLs
- Least privilege enforcement
- Emergency access procedures
- ACL sprawl management

## Integration Points

### With Other ACR Layers

**Behavioral Policy Enforcement (Layer 2):**
- Identity binding provides context for policy decisions
- Policies reference agent_id and purpose in rules
- Example: "agent_id:customer-support-* may not execute queries containing 'DELETE'"

**Execution Observability (Layer 4):**
- All telemetry includes agent_id for attribution
- Purpose recorded in audit logs
- Identity changes trigger observability events

**Self-Healing & Containment (Layer 5):**
- Identity revocation is a containment action
- Purpose downgrade (e.g., READ_WRITE → READ_ONLY) as degradation step
- Kill switch can target specific agent_ids or purposes

**Human Authority (Layer 6):**
- Humans approve identity binding at deployment
- Capability expansion requires human authorization
- Override actions are identity-scoped

### With External Systems

**Identity Providers:**
- Integration with enterprise IAM (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0)
- SPIFFE/SPIRE for cloud-native workload identity
- Service mesh identity integration (Istio, Linkerd)

**Secret Management:**
- Vault integration for credential rotation
- Cloud provider secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Encrypted credential storage and retrieval

**Audit Systems:**
- Identity events exported to SIEM
- Compliance reporting on identity lifecycle
- Alert on anomalous identity behavior

## Enforcement Points

### API Gateway
- Validate tokens on ingress
- Enforce purpose-based routing
- Block unauthorized operations before model invocation
- **Latency impact:** 5-20ms per request

### Service Mesh
- Mutual TLS for workload identity
- Network policy enforcement
- Service-to-service authorization
- **Latency impact:** 10-30ms per connection establishment

### SDK Wrapper
- Client-side token acquisition
- Local authorization checks before API calls
- Fail-safe defaults (deny if identity unavailable)
- **Latency impact:** <5ms (local checks)

### Database Proxy
- Intercept queries and validate agent identity
- Enforce row-level or column-level access
- Audit all data access with agent attribution
- **Latency impact:** 5-15ms per query

## Design Considerations

### Performance Trade-offs

**Token Validation Overhead:**
- Cryptographic signature verification: 1-5ms
- Claim parsing and evaluation: <1ms
- External identity provider calls: 50-200ms (cacheable)

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Token caching with TTL
- Offline token validation (shared secret or public key)
- Background token renewal
- Batch authorization checks where possible

### Security Trade-offs

**Token Lifetime:**
- **Short (5-15 minutes):** More secure, higher renewal overhead
- **Long (1-24 hours):** Less secure, lower overhead
- **Recommendation:** 15-30 minutes for production systems

**Credential Storage:**
- **In-memory only:** Secure but requires re-auth on restart
- **Encrypted disk:** Persistent but vulnerable to disk access
- **External vault:** Most secure but adds latency and dependency
- **Recommendation:** External vault for production

### Operational Trade-offs

**Centralized vs. Distributed Identity:**
- **Centralized:** Single source of truth, potential bottleneck
- **Distributed:** Higher availability, consistency challenges
- **Recommendation:** Centralized with caching, geo-distributed for global deployments

**Static vs. Dynamic Binding:**
- **Static:** Identity set at deployment, simple but inflexible
- **Dynamic:** Identity adapts to context, complex but powerful
- **Recommendation:** Static binding for most use cases, dynamic for advanced scenarios

## Failure Modes

### Identity Provider Unavailable
**Symptom:** Cannot validate tokens or issue new ones
**Impact:** All AI operations blocked if no cached tokens
**Mitigation:** 
- Local token cache with extended TTL during outage
- Failover to secondary identity provider
- Offline validation using shared secrets
**Recovery:** Resume normal validation when identity provider returns

### Token Expiration During Long Operations
**Symptom:** Multi-step workflows fail mid-execution
**Impact:** Partial completion, inconsistent state
**Mitigation:**
- Background token renewal before expiration
- Workflow-level token refresh capability
- Transaction rollback on authentication failure
**Recovery:** Retry workflow with fresh token

### Purpose Mismatch After Deployment
**Symptom:** Deployed system's actual behavior doesn't match bound purpose
**Impact:** Either excessive denials (purpose too narrow) or insufficient controls (purpose too broad)
**Mitigation:**
- Pre-deployment validation of purpose fit
- Staging environment testing with real-world scenarios
- Gradual rollout with monitoring
**Recovery:** Re-bind system with corrected purpose, redeploy

### Identity Spoofing Attack
**Symptom:** Malicious system presents stolen or forged identity token
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources under legitimate identity
**Mitigation:**
- Mutual TLS to verify both client and server
- Token binding to network identity or hardware
- Anomalous behavior detection tied to identity
- Short token lifetimes to limit exposure window
**Recovery:** Revoke compromised identity, rotate all credentials, investigate breach scope

## Evaluation Criteria

An ACR-compliant implementation of Identity & Purpose Binding should satisfy:

### Mandatory Requirements
1. **Unique Identity:** Every AI system has a unique, verifiable identifier
2. **Cryptographic Binding:** Identity uses cryptographic proof (signatures, certificates)
3. **Purpose Definition:** System's authorized purpose is explicitly defined
4. **Resource Authorization:** Access to each resource requires explicit grant
5. **Deny by Default:** Operations not explicitly authorized are denied
6. **Audit Trail:** All identity lifecycle events are logged

### Recommended Features
1. **Token Rotation:** Automated credential renewal without manual intervention
2. **Least Privilege:** Minimal capabilities granted to achieve purpose
3. **Scope Expansion Control:** Capability additions require approval workflow
4. **Revocation Support:** Ability to immediately invalidate compromised identities
5. **Multi-Factor Binding:** Identity tied to multiple attributes (workload + network + time)

### Advanced Capabilities
1. **Context-Aware Authorization:** Permissions vary based on time, location, or system state
2. **Delegation Support:** Temporary capability grants to other systems
3. **Federated Identity:** Cross-organization identity trust
4. **Hardware-Backed Identity:** TPM or secure enclave binding

## Open Research Questions

1. **Dynamic Purpose Adaptation:** How should systems handle gradual purpose evolution without full re-deployment?

2. **Purpose Composition:** Can complex purposes be composed from simpler primitives? What's the taxonomy?

3. **Cross-Model Identity:** How should identity work for systems using multiple models (e.g., GPT-4 for reasoning, Whisper for transcription)?

4. **Decentralized Identity:** Can AI systems use decentralized identity protocols (DIDs) for trustless binding?

5. **Purpose Drift Detection:** How to detect when actual system behavior diverges from declared purpose (separate from behavioral drift)?

6. **Identity Recovery:** What's the process for recovering from mass identity compromise without operational outage?
