# ACR Framework
## Autonomous Control & Resilience for AI Systems

The **ACR Framework (Autonomous Control & Resilience)** is a runtime governance architecture designed to control autonomous AI systems operating in enterprise environments.

As AI systems evolve from static models into **autonomous agents capable of interacting with enterprise infrastructure**, traditional governance approaches—based primarily on policy documentation—are no longer sufficient.

ACR introduces a **runtime control architecture** that allows organizations to monitor, constrain, and intervene in AI system behavior while those systems are operating in production environments.

## ACR Framework Architecture

# Why ACR Exists

Most enterprise AI governance programs today focus on:

- policy documentation  
- model approval workflows  
- risk classification processes  

While necessary, these approaches do not provide mechanisms for **controlling AI behavior at runtime**.

As organizations deploy increasingly autonomous AI systems, new governance challenges emerge:

- AI systems accessing enterprise data sources
- AI agents interacting with operational systems
- model outputs influencing business decisions
- adversarial manipulation of AI workflows

The ACR Framework was designed to address these challenges by introducing a **control architecture for autonomous AI systems**.

---

# Core Principles

ACR is built on the principle that **AI governance must operate during system execution**, not only during system design.

The framework introduces six operational control layers.

---

# ACR Control Layers

## Identity & Purpose Binding

Every AI system must operate with a clearly defined identity and purpose.

AI services should be bound to:

- defined operational objectives
- approved data sources
- authorized tool access
- clearly scoped capabilities

This ensures that AI systems cannot operate outside their intended domain.

---

## Behavioral Policy Enforcement

Governance policies must translate into **machine-enforceable rules**.

ACR enforces boundaries around:

- data access
- tool invocation
- output behavior
- system permissions

This ensures AI systems operate within defined governance constraints.

---

## Autonomy Drift Detection

AI systems evolve as prompts change, tools expand, and workflows grow.

ACR introduces mechanisms to detect when system behavior begins to deviate from its original design parameters.

This helps identify **autonomy drift**, where systems begin operating outside intended governance boundaries.

---

## Execution Observability

Traditional governance frameworks rarely provide visibility into AI execution.

ACR introduces **execution observability**, allowing organizations to inspect:

- AI inputs
- reasoning processes
- outputs
- system interactions

This enables organizations to audit AI behavior after deployment.

---

## Self-Healing & Containment

Autonomous systems require mechanisms for rapid containment when abnormal behavior is detected.

ACR enables automated responses such as:

- capability restriction
- workflow interruption
- system isolation
- escalation to human review

This reduces the impact of unexpected or adversarial behavior.

---

## Human Authority

Autonomous systems must operate within defined structures that preserve human authority.

ACR ensures that organizations maintain the ability to:

- intervene in AI operations
- override automated decisions
- escalate high-risk scenarios

This ensures human oversight remains central to AI governance.

---

# Runtime Governance Architecture

ACR operates as a **control layer between AI systems and enterprise infrastructure**.

Example architecture:

Enterprise Applications  
↓  
AI Models / Autonomous Agents  
↓  
**ACR Runtime Control Layer**  
↓  
Enterprise Systems & Data

This architecture allows governance controls to be enforced during system operation rather than only during development.

---

# Relationship to Existing Governance Frameworks

ACR complements existing governance and risk frameworks including:

- NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)
- ISO/IEC 42001 AI Management Systems

While those frameworks define **governance structures and risk management processes**, ACR focuses on **runtime enforcement of governance controls for autonomous systems**.

---

# Example Production Lifecycle

AI systems governed by ACR typically follow a lifecycle including:

1. Model Development  
2. Governance Binding  
3. Deployment into Controlled Runtime Environment  
4. Continuous Monitoring  
5. Drift Detection and Intervention  
6. Post-Execution Audit  

ACR ensures governance controls remain active throughout this lifecycle.
