# Human Authority Specification

**ACR Control Layer 6 of 6**

## Purpose

Ensure that accountable authority over consequential decisions remains human. Autonomous systems may assist, accelerate, and recommend, but humans retain override rights, escalation authority, and decision control over high-impact outcomes. This pillar defines who can approve, who can override, when escalation is required, and how exception paths are governed.

## Control Objectives

1. **Action Tiering:** Classify all agent actions into risk-based tiers (low-risk autonomous, medium-risk gated, high-risk human-approval required) with clear criteria for each level
2. **Escalation Authority Matrix:** Define who can approve what, with delegation limits, approval hierarchy, and fallback paths
3. **Timeout & Fallback Handling:** Ensure high-risk actions do not proceed indefinitely without human response — define SLAs, timeout behavior, and safe defaults
4. **Break-Glass Override:** Provide emergency bypass capability with mandatory logging, multi-party authorization, time-limited tokens, and required after-action review
5. **Accountability Chain:** Maintain an unbroken record of human decisions, approvals, and overrides for audit and governance purposes

## Scope

### In Scope
- Action risk tiering criteria and classification
- Approval workflow design and implementation
- Escalation path definition and routing
- Timeout handling and fallback behavior
- Break-glass emergency override procedures
- Human decision logging and accountability
- Approval queue management and SLA enforcement

### Out of Scope
- End-user consent flows (application layer responsibility)
- HR approval workflows unrelated to AI operations
- Model selection and evaluation decisions (pre-deployment governance)
- Budget approval for AI infrastructure (organizational finance)

## Architectural Patterns

### Pattern 1: Risk-Based Action Tiering

**Mechanism:** Every agent action is classified into a risk tier that determines whether it proceeds autonomously, queues for review, or blocks until explicitly approved

**Technologies:**
- Policy-as-code rules that evaluate action risk at runtime
- Risk scoring functions based on action type, dollar value, data sensitivity, and agent risk tier
- Configuration-driven tier definitions (YAML/JSON)

**Implementation approach:**
```
Action Tier Definitions:

Tier 1 — Low Risk (Autonomous):
  Criteria: Read-only data access, knowledge base search, internal logging
  Behavior: Auto-approved, logged
  Examples:
    - Query customer record (read-only)
    - Search knowledge base
    - Generate report from existing data
  Approval: None required
  SLA: N/A

Tier 2 — Medium Risk (Gated):
  Criteria: State-modifying actions, outbound communications, cost-incurring operations
  Behavior: Async review, proceeds if approved within SLA
  Examples:
    - Send email to customer
    - Create support ticket
    - Update customer record
    - Tool invocation with cost < $50
  Approval: Agent owner or designated reviewer
  SLA: 1 hour

Tier 3 — High Risk (Human Required):
  Criteria: Financial transactions, PII bulk access, production deployments, irreversible actions
  Behavior: Blocked until human explicitly approves
  Examples:
    - Issue refund > $100
    - Access PII bulk export
    - Deploy to production
    - Delete customer data
    - Modify billing records
  Approval: Senior reviewer or manager (per escalation matrix)
  SLA: 4 hours (default)
  Timeout: Deny (action does not proceed)
```

**Design considerations:**
- Tier assignment must be deterministic and auditable (not subjective)
- Tier boundaries should be configurable per agent without code changes
- Edge cases: actions that span tiers (e.g., small refund that becomes large) need re-evaluation
- New action types default to Tier 3 (high risk) until explicitly classified

### Pattern 2: Approval Queue System

**Mechanism:** Dedicated queue service receives approval requests, routes them to appropriate reviewers, enforces SLAs, and handles timeouts

**Technologies:**
- Custom microservice with persistent queue (Redis, SQS, database-backed)
- Slack bot for reviewer interaction
- Step Functions / Temporal for workflow orchestration
- Mobile push notifications for time-sensitive approvals

**Implementation approach:**
```
Approval Request Flow:

1. Agent action classified as Tier 2 or Tier 3
2. Control plane creates approval request:
   {
     request_id: "uuid",
     agent_id: "customer-support-01",
     action: { tool: "issue_refund", parameters: { amount: 250 } },
     risk_tier: 3,
     required_approver_role: "finance_reviewer",
     sla_deadline: "2026-03-16T18:22:00Z",
     timeout_action: "deny",
     context: { customer_id: "...", reason: "...", session_trace: "..." }
   }
3. Queue routes to eligible approvers based on escalation matrix
4. Notification sent: Slack message, email, mobile push
5. Reviewer sees: action summary, agent context, risk assessment
6. Reviewer decides: Approve / Deny / Escalate / Request More Context
7. Decision logged and returned to control plane
8. If approved: action proceeds with approval metadata attached
9. If denied: agent notified, alternative action suggested if available
10. If timeout: default action (deny for Tier 3, configurable for Tier 2)

Escalation on Non-Response:
  T+0:    Primary reviewer notified
  T+50%:  Reminder sent to primary reviewer
  T+75%:  Secondary reviewer notified (backup)
  T+100%: Timeout action executed (default: deny)
```

**Design considerations:**
- Approval requests must include sufficient context for informed decisions (not just "approve this action?")
- Reviewers should see agent identity, purpose, recent action history, and drift score
- Queue depth monitoring: alert if pending approvals exceed capacity
- Batch approval: allow reviewers to approve multiple similar low-risk items at once (Tier 2 only)
- Approval delegation: allow temporary delegation during reviewer PTO

### Pattern 3: Break-Glass Override

**Mechanism:** Emergency bypass that allows actions to proceed outside normal approval flows, with mandatory logging, multi-party authorization, and required after-action review

**Technologies:**
- Time-limited override tokens (JWT with short expiry)
- Multi-party authorization (2+ approvers required)
- Mandatory audit log entries with tamper-evident storage
- After-action review workflow integration

**Implementation approach:**
```
Break-Glass Activation:

1. Operator determines emergency override is needed
   (e.g., automated containment is blocking critical business operation)

2. Operator requests break-glass token:
   POST /acr/break-glass
   {
     agent_id: "customer-support-01",
     reason: "Customer escalation requires immediate refund during system maintenance",
     operator: "oncall@example.com",
     requested_duration_minutes: 60,
     requested_permissions: ["issue_refund"]
   }

3. Second approver confirms (multi-party requirement):
   POST /acr/break-glass/confirm
   {
     request_id: "uuid",
     confirmer: "security-lead@example.com"
   }

4. Time-limited override token issued:
   {
     token: "eyJ...",
     expires_at: "2026-03-16T15:22:00Z",
     permissions: ["issue_refund"],
     max_uses: 5,
     audit_id: "bg-2026-0316-001"
   }

5. Agent operates with override token (all actions logged with audit_id)

6. Token expires automatically after duration

7. After-action review required within 24 hours:
   - What happened?
   - Why was normal approval insufficient?
   - What actions were taken under override?
   - Should policy or thresholds be adjusted?
```

**Design considerations:**
- Break-glass tokens must have maximum duration (4 hours recommended, 24 hours absolute max)
- Multi-party authorization prevents single-person bypass of controls
- All actions under break-glass are logged with elevated audit priority
- After-action review is mandatory, not optional — tracked as compliance requirement
- Break-glass usage frequency is a metric: high frequency indicates policy/threshold problems

### Pattern 4: Escalation Authority Matrix

**Mechanism:** Formal definition of who can approve what, with delegation limits, backup paths, and conflict resolution

**Technologies:**
- RBAC/ABAC with approval-specific roles
- Configuration-driven matrix (YAML/database)
- Integration with enterprise directory (LDAP, Azure AD, Okta)

**Implementation approach:**
```
Escalation Authority Matrix:

| Action Category    | Tier | Primary Approver      | Backup Approver    | Delegation Allowed |
|--------------------|------|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Customer comms     | 2    | Support team lead     | Support manager    | Yes (to senior agents) |
| Refund < $100      | 2    | Support team lead     | Finance reviewer   | Yes |
| Refund $100-$1000  | 3    | Finance reviewer      | Finance manager    | No |
| Refund > $1000     | 3    | Finance manager       | VP Finance         | No |
| PII access         | 3    | Privacy officer       | CISO               | No |
| Production deploy  | 3    | Engineering manager   | VP Engineering     | No |
| Data deletion      | 3    | Data governance lead  | CISO               | No |
| Break-glass        | —    | Any 2 of: CISO, VP Eng, CTO | —           | No |

Delegation Rules:
  - Delegation expires after 7 days or delegator return (whichever first)
  - Delegate cannot further delegate
  - Delegation is logged with delegator, delegate, scope, and duration
  - Tier 3 actions cannot be delegated (explicit in matrix)

Conflict Resolution:
  - If primary and backup disagree: escalate to next level
  - If no approver available within SLA: timeout action (deny for Tier 3)
  - If approver has conflict of interest: auto-route to backup
```

**Design considerations:**
- Matrix must be version-controlled with change history
- Matrix changes require approval from governance authority (not self-approved)
- Regular review (quarterly) to ensure matrix reflects current organizational structure
- Integration with HR systems to auto-update when personnel change roles

## Integration Points

### With Other ACR Layers

**Identity & Purpose Binding (Pillar 1):**
- Human approvers are authenticated through enterprise identity system
- Agent identity context is included in approval requests for reviewer visibility
- Approval decisions are bound to approver identity with non-repudiation

**Behavioral Policy Enforcement (Pillar 2):**
- Policies determine which actions require human approval (Tier 2/3 classification)
- Policy changes (new rules, threshold adjustments) require human authorization
- Break-glass overrides temporarily modify policy enforcement with full logging

**Autonomy Drift Detection (Pillar 3):**
- Drift alerts at warning level notify human reviewers for assessment
- Critical drift may require human authorization before agent can resume
- Human investigation findings inform drift threshold adjustments

**Execution Observability (Pillar 4):**
- All approval requests, decisions, and timeouts are logged as human_intervention events
- Approval response time is measurable from telemetry data for SLA tracking
- Break-glass usage is tracked as a governance metric

**Self-Healing & Containment (Pillar 5):**
- Recovery from containment requires human approval through the authority framework
- Kill switch activation by operators is logged with full identity and justification
- Break-glass may override automated containment in emergencies

### With External Systems

**Communication Platforms:**
- Slack / Microsoft Teams for approval notifications and interactive approval buttons
- Email for asynchronous approval with secure approval links
- Mobile push notifications for time-sensitive Tier 3 approvals
- SMS as last-resort escalation for critical approvals

**Ticketing Systems:**
- Jira / ServiceNow for approval request tracking and audit trail
- Automatic ticket creation for break-glass events
- SLA monitoring integration for approval queue health

**Enterprise Directory:**
- LDAP / Azure AD / Okta for approver role resolution
- Automatic matrix updates when personnel change roles
- Group-based routing for approval queue assignment

## Enforcement Points

### Approval Gate (Synchronous)
- Agent action blocked at control plane until approval received or timeout
- Approval check adds latency equal to human response time (minutes to hours)
- For Tier 3: no bypass without break-glass token
- **Latency impact:** Human-dependent (minutes to hours)

### Timeout Handler (Background)
- SLA timer starts when approval request is created
- Escalation logic executes at configured intervals (50%, 75%, 100% of SLA)
- Timeout action executed when SLA expires (configurable: deny, escalate, safe-default)
- **Latency impact:** None (timer-based)

### Break-Glass Endpoint (Synchronous)
- Token issuance requires multi-party authentication
- Token validation on every action during override period
- Token auto-expiry enforced by control plane
- **Latency impact:** Token validation <5ms

## Design Considerations

### Approval Fatigue

**Challenge:** Too many approval requests cause reviewers to rubber-stamp without evaluation

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. **Right-size Tier 2:** Only gate actions that genuinely warrant human review — over-classification erodes reviewer attention
2. **Batch approvals:** Allow reviewers to approve multiple similar Tier 2 items at once (e.g., "approve all customer emails from this agent today")
3. **Smart routing:** Route to reviewers with domain expertise, not a generic queue
4. **Context-rich requests:** Include agent summary, risk assessment, and recent history so reviewers can decide quickly
5. **Approval metrics:** Monitor approval time and rubber-stamp rate (>95% approval rate may indicate over-classification)

### Accountability Gap

**Challenge:** When an agent takes an action that was auto-approved (Tier 1), who is accountable for the outcome?

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. Agent owner is accountable for all Tier 1 actions — this is defined at registration time
2. Tier classification itself is a governance decision with an approver
3. Audit trail connects every action to the policy that permitted it and the person who approved the policy
4. Periodic review of Tier 1 outcomes to identify actions that should be reclassified

### SLA Tuning

**Challenge:** Too-short SLAs cause legitimate approvals to timeout; too-long SLAs delay critical operations

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. Start with conservative SLAs (4 hours for Tier 3, 1 hour for Tier 2) and adjust based on data
2. Track approval response time percentiles (P50, P95) and timeout rates
3. Different SLAs for business hours vs. after-hours
4. Emergency path (break-glass) available when SLA is insufficient for urgent situations

## Failure Modes

### Approval Queue Backlog
**Symptom:** Pending approval requests grow faster than reviewers can process
**Impact:** Agent operations stall; SLA timeouts increase; business processes delayed
**Mitigation:**
- Queue depth monitoring with alert at configurable threshold (e.g., >20 pending)
- Automatic escalation to backup reviewers when queue exceeds capacity
- Temporary Tier 2 → Tier 1 downgrade for low-risk actions during backlog (with logging)
- Staff capacity planning based on historical approval volume
**Recovery:** Clear backlog with batch approvals; review tier classifications for over-classification

### Approver Unavailable
**Symptom:** Primary and backup approvers both unreachable within SLA
**Impact:** Tier 3 actions timeout and are denied; business impact
**Mitigation:**
- Minimum 2 approvers per action category in escalation matrix
- On-call rotation for Tier 3 approval authority
- Graceful timeout behavior: deny + notify agent owner + create follow-up ticket
- Break-glass path available for genuine emergencies
**Recovery:** Ensure coverage gaps are addressed in escalation matrix review

### Break-Glass Abuse
**Symptom:** Break-glass used routinely instead of through normal approval flow
**Impact:** Controls effectively bypassed; governance integrity compromised
**Mitigation:**
- Track break-glass frequency as a governance metric (target: <2 per month)
- Mandatory after-action review for every break-glass event
- High frequency triggers governance review of approval SLAs and tier classifications
- Multi-party requirement makes casual break-glass usage impractical
**Recovery:** Review root causes of break-glass events; adjust policies, thresholds, or SLAs to reduce need

### Approval Spoofing
**Symptom:** Unauthorized party approves an action by impersonating a legitimate approver
**Impact:** Unauthorized agent actions with fabricated approval chain
**Mitigation:**
- Approver authentication through enterprise SSO (not email-based approval links alone)
- Multi-factor authentication required for Tier 3 approvals
- Approval decisions signed with approver's identity token
- Approval audit trail with IP address, device, and session metadata
**Recovery:** Revoke spoofed approvals; contain affected agent; investigate identity compromise

## Evaluation Criteria

### Mandatory Requirements
1. **Action tiering** defined with clear, deterministic criteria for low/medium/high risk classification
2. **Escalation authority matrix** documented with primary and backup approvers per action category
3. **Timeout handling** with defined SLA and fallback behavior (deny for Tier 3 by default)
4. **Human decision logging** with approver identity, decision, timestamp, and justification for every approval
5. **Break-glass procedures** documented with multi-party authorization and mandatory after-action review
6. **Accountability chain** connecting every agent action to either automatic policy or human decision

### Recommended Features
1. **Approval queue with SLA enforcement** and automated escalation on non-response
2. **Context-rich approval requests** including agent identity, action details, risk assessment, and recent history
3. **Communication platform integration** (Slack, Teams, email, mobile push) for reviewer notification
4. **Batch approval capability** for high-volume Tier 2 requests
5. **Delegation support** with time-limited scope and audit trail

### Advanced Capabilities
1. **Adaptive tier classification** that adjusts risk tier based on agent drift score and recent behavior
2. **Approval pattern analysis** detecting rubber-stamping, approval fatigue, or unusual approval patterns
3. **Predictive queue management** forecasting approval volume and staffing needs
4. **Cross-agent approval correlation** identifying patterns where multiple agents request similar high-risk actions

## Open Research Questions

1. **Optimal Human Oversight Level:** How much human oversight is enough? Over-approval creates fatigue and rubber-stamping; under-approval creates risk. Is there a measurable optimum?

2. **Human-AI Approval Collaboration:** Can AI assist human reviewers by pre-scoring approval requests, highlighting anomalies, or suggesting decisions — without undermining human authority?

3. **Scalability of Human Authority:** As organizations deploy hundreds or thousands of agents, how does the approval model scale? Is there a tipping point where human-in-the-loop becomes operationally infeasible?

4. **Accountability in Multi-Agent Chains:** When Agent A's action is approved by a human but triggers Agent B's autonomous action that causes harm, how is accountability distributed?

5. **Break-Glass Governance:** What governance framework prevents break-glass from becoming a normalized bypass? How do organizations measure whether their break-glass usage indicates healthy exceptions vs. systemic control failures?

6. **Cross-Organizational Authority:** When agents operate across organizational boundaries (vendor agents accessing customer systems), whose human authority governs? How are approval chains federated?
