# Contributing to ACR Standard

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ACR (Agentic Control at Runtime) Standard. ACR is an open reference architecture for runtime governance of autonomous AI systems. Contributions to specifications, design patterns, and documentation are welcome.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details.

## How to Contribute

### Contribution Areas

- **Control layer refinements and extensions** — Improve pillar specifications, add implementation patterns, or propose new control objectives
- **Implementation pattern documentation** — Document deployment patterns, technology integrations, or migration approaches
- **Threat model expansion** — New attack vectors, mitigations, detection strategies, or STRIKE category refinements
- **Standards mappings** — EU AI Act, sector-specific regulations, or deeper NIST/ISO/SOC 2 mappings
- **Case studies and deployment experiences** — Real-world adoption stories (anonymized or with permission)
- **Research and open questions** — Drift detection methods, policy languages, observability schemas

### Contribution Process

1. **Review existing issues and discussions**  
   Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AdamDiStefanoAI/acr-framework/issues) and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AdamDiStefanoAI/acr-framework/discussions) to see if your idea is already under discussion.

2. **Open an issue**  
   Describe your proposed contribution, the problem it addresses, and how it aligns with ACR principles. For large changes, discuss the approach before submitting a pull request.

3. **Discuss approach and alignment**  
   Maintainers and the community will review and may suggest adjustments to align with the framework’s scope and structure.

4. **Submit a pull request**  
   - Branch from `main`  
   - Update documentation in the appropriate location under [docs/](docs/)  
   - Follow the existing markdown style and structure  
   - Keep changes focused; prefer multiple small PRs over one large one  

5. **Community review and merge**  
   Maintainers will review your PR. Address feedback and ensure any link or path updates are consistent with the [docs/](docs/) layout.

### Code Contributions

ACR is an **architectural framework**. The core repository focuses on specifications, design patterns, and architectural guidance. Reference implementations are welcome and may live in this repo under `implementations/` or be linked from the [Implementations](README.md#implementations) section via a pull request.

### Documentation Structure

- **Pillar specifications:** [docs/pillars/](docs/pillars/)
- **Architecture:** [docs/architecture/](docs/architecture/)
- **Specifications:** [docs/specifications/](docs/specifications/)
- **Compliance:** [docs/compliance/](docs/compliance/)
- **Security:** [docs/security/](docs/security/)
- **Guides:** [docs/guides/](docs/guides/)
- **Images:** [docs/images/](docs/images/)

When adding or moving documents, update internal links so they work from the new paths (e.g. from `docs/pillars/` use `../architecture/` for architecture docs and `../../README.md` for the repo root).

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive titles and descriptions
- Reference any related issues
- Ensure all internal links are valid (see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) for tooling plans)
- For specification changes, consider impact on existing implementations and the [Implementation Guide](docs/guides/acr-implementation-guide.md)

### Questions

- **Architecture and design:** [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AdamDiStefanoAI/acr-framework/discussions)
- **Bugs and clarifications:** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AdamDiStefanoAI/acr-framework/issues)

Thank you for helping advance runtime governance for autonomous AI systems.
