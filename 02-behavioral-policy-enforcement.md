# Behavioral Policy Enforcement Specification

**ACR Control Layer 2 of 6**

## Purpose

Translate governance policies into machine-enforceable runtime rules that constrain AI system behavior during operation, ensuring compliance with security, privacy, and business requirements.

## Control Objectives

1. **Input Validation:** Verify all inputs meet security and compliance requirements before processing
2. **Output Filtering:** Prevent harmful, inappropriate, or policy-violating content in responses
3. **Action Authorization:** Control which operations AI systems can perform
4. **Data Handling Enforcement:** Ensure proper treatment of sensitive information
5. **Real-Time Policy Execution:** Enforce rules during inference, not post-hoc

## Scope

### In Scope
- Pre-inference input validation
- Post-inference output filtering
- Per-action authorization for tool/API calls
- Data classification and handling enforcement
- Policy versioning and rollback
- Policy conflict resolution

### Out of Scope
- Model training governance (pre-deployment)
- Infrastructure access control (Layer 1: Identity Binding)
- Anomaly detection (Layer 3: Drift Detection)
- Incident response automation (Layer 5: Containment)

## Architectural Patterns

### Pattern 1: Policy-as-Code Engines

**Mechanism:** Declarative policy languages evaluated at runtime

**Technologies:**
- Open Policy Agent (OPA) with Rego language
- AWS Cedar policy language
- HashiCorp Sentinel
- Custom DSL implementations

**Implementation approach:**
```rego
# Example OPA policy for customer support agent

package acr.customer_support

# Deny prompts attempting SQL injection
deny["SQL injection attempt detected"] {
    input.prompt
    regex.match(`(?i)(union|select|insert|delete|drop)\s+`, input.prompt)
}

# Redact SSN from outputs
redact_ssn(output) = result {
    result := regex.replace(
        output,
        `\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}`,
        "***-**-****"
    )
}

# Allow only approved tools
allowed_tools = ["query_customer_db", "send_email", "create_ticket"]

deny["Unauthorized tool invocation"] {
    input.tool_call
    not input.tool_call.name in allowed_tools
}
```

**Design considerations:**
- Policy language complexity vs. expressiveness
- Evaluation performance (target <20ms per policy)
- Policy testing and validation before deployment
- Versioning strategy for policy updates

### Pattern 2: Rule-Based Validators

**Mechanism:** Pre-defined rules using regex, schema validation, or logic

**Technologies:**
- JSON Schema for input/output structure validation
- Regular expressions for pattern matching
- Business rule engines (Drools, Easy Rules)

**Implementation approach:**
```yaml
# Example rule-based policy configuration

input_rules:
  - rule_id: no_sql_injection
    type: regex_deny
    pattern: '(?i)(union|select|insert|delete|drop)\s+'
    error_message: "SQL injection attempt detected"
    
  - rule_id: max_prompt_length
    type: length_limit
    max_chars: 10000
    error_message: "Prompt exceeds maximum length"

output_rules:
  - rule_id: redact_ssn
    type: regex_replace
    pattern: '\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}'
    replacement: '***-**-****'
    
  - rule_id: redact_credit_card
    type: regex_replace
    pattern: '\d{4}[- ]?\d{4}[- ]?\d{4}[- ]?\d{4}'
    replacement: '****-****-****-****'

  - rule_id: block_financial_advice
    type: content_classification
    blocked_categories: ["financial_advice", "investment_recommendations"]
    confidence_threshold: 0.7
```

**Design considerations:**
- Rule ordering and evaluation sequence
- False positive handling
- Rule maintenance and updates
- Performance optimization (compiled regex, indexed lookups)

### Pattern 3: ML-Based Classifiers

**Mechanism:** Machine learning models evaluate content against policies

**Technologies:**
- Content safety APIs (Azure Content Safety, Perspective API)
- Custom classifiers (toxicity, PII, topic detection)
- Embedding-based similarity checks

**Implementation approach:**
```
Input Validation Flow:
1. Extract text from user input
2. Send to content safety classifier
3. Receive scores:
   - toxicity: 0.12 (safe)
   - sexual: 0.05 (safe)
   - violence: 0.89 (BLOCK)
4. Policy decision: DENY if any score > threshold

Output Filtering Flow:
1. Generate model response
2. Send to PII detection model
3. Identify entities:
   - "John Smith" (PERSON)
   - "123-45-6789" (SSN)
   - "john@example.com" (EMAIL)
4. Apply redaction:
   - Keep PERSON (contextually necessary)
   - Redact SSN → "***-**-****"
   - Redact EMAIL → "[EMAIL REDACTED]"
5. Return filtered response
```

**Design considerations:**
- Classifier latency (can be 100-500ms)
- Confidence threshold tuning (false positive vs. false negative trade-off)
- Model drift in classifiers themselves
- Fallback behavior when classifier unavailable

### Pattern 4: Hybrid Approach

**Mechanism:** Combine rule-based and ML-based techniques

**Implementation approach:**
```
Policy Evaluation Pipeline:

Phase 1: Fast Rules (target <5ms)
├── Regex-based SQL injection check
├── Prompt length limit
├── Known bad pattern matching
└── Decision: PASS → Phase 2, DENY → Block immediately

Phase 2: Structured Validation (target <10ms)
├── JSON schema validation
├── Data type checking
├── Required field verification
└── Decision: PASS → Phase 3, DENY → Block

Phase 3: ML Classification (target <100ms)
├── Content safety scoring
├── PII detection
├── Topic classification
└── Decision: PASS → Allow, DENY → Block

Total budget: <120ms for complete policy evaluation
```

**Design considerations:**
- Pipeline short-circuiting (fail fast)
- Parallel execution where possible
- Caching of ML classifier results
- Graceful degradation if ML services unavailable

## Enforcement Points

### Pre-Inference (Input Validation)
**Location:** Before model API call
**Latency target:** <50ms
**Actions:** Block, transform input, log warning

**Example flow:**
```
User prompt → Input policies → Transform/Block → Model API
```

### Post-Inference (Output Filtering)
**Location:** After model generates response
**Latency target:** <100ms
**Actions:** Redact, block entirely, modify content

**Example flow:**
```
Model response → Output policies → Redact/Block → Return to user
```

### Per-Action (Tool Authorization)
**Location:** Before each tool/API invocation
**Latency target:** <20ms per action
**Actions:** Allow, deny, require approval

**Example flow:**
```
Model requests tool call → Action policies → Allow/Deny → Execute tool
```

### Continuous (Data Handling)
**Location:** Throughout request lifecycle
**Latency target:** Minimal (passive classification)
**Actions:** Tag data, enforce handling, audit access

**Example flow:**
```
Data accessed → Classify → Apply handling rules → Audit
```

## Integration Points

### With Other ACR Layers

**Identity & Purpose Binding (Layer 1):**
- Policies reference agent_id and purpose
- Purpose determines which policies apply
- Example: `if agent.purpose == "customer_support" then allow_customer_db_query`

**Autonomy Drift Detection (Layer 3):**
- Policy violation frequency is a drift indicator
- Sudden changes in which policies trigger indicate behavioral shift
- Baseline includes "normal" policy violation rate (e.g., 0.5%)

**Execution Observability (Layer 4):**
- Every policy decision logged with:
  - policy_id, decision (allow/deny), latency, confidence (for ML)
- Telemetry enables policy effectiveness analysis
- Audit compliance through policy decision logs

**Self-Healing & Containment (Layer 5):**
- High-severity policy violations trigger containment
- Example: 3 SQL injection attempts in 5 minutes → isolate agent
- Policy violation severity determines response action

**Human Authority (Layer 6):**
- High-risk actions gate on human approval
- Humans can override policy decisions temporarily
- Policy modifications require human authorization

### With External Systems

**Content Safety APIs:**
- Azure Content Safety, Perspective API, OpenAI Moderation
- Real-time or batch evaluation
- Confidence scores inform policy decisions

**Data Loss Prevention (DLP):**
- Integration with enterprise DLP systems
- Unified policy management across AI and traditional apps
- Consistent PII/PHI detection

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
- Policy violation events to SIEM
- Correlation with other security events
- Alert triggering for high-severity violations

## Design Considerations

### Latency Budget

**Total policy overhead target: <150ms**

Breakdown:
- Input validation: <50ms
- Output filtering: <100ms
- Action authorization: <20ms per action

**Mitigation strategies for latency:**
- Cache policy evaluation results
- Parallel policy execution where independent
- Short-circuit evaluation (fail fast)
- Async policy checks for non-blocking policies

### False Positive Management

**Challenge:** Overly strict policies block legitimate use

**Strategies:**
1. **Confidence thresholds:** Require high confidence for blocking (e.g., >0.9)
2. **Human review queue:** Flag uncertain cases for manual review
3. **Feedback loops:** Users report false positives, policies adjusted
4. **Shadow mode:** Run new policies in observe-only mode first
5. **Gradual rollout:** Deploy to small percentage of traffic initially

### Policy Conflict Resolution

**Scenario:** Multiple policies apply to same input, with conflicting decisions

**Resolution strategies:**
1. **Deny-by-default:** If any policy denies, overall decision is deny
2. **Priority-based:** Policies have explicit priority ordering
3. **Most-restrictive:** Apply strictest policy when conflicts exist
4. **Context-dependent:** Resolution logic varies by scenario

**Recommendation:** Deny-by-default for security/compliance, priority-based for business policies

### Policy Versioning

**Challenge:** Policies evolve but need version control

**Approaches:**
1. **Semantic versioning:** Major/minor/patch versions for policies
2. **Immutable policies:** Each change creates new policy, old archived
3. **Git-based:** Store policies in version control
4. **Rollback capability:** Quickly revert to previous policy version

**Recommendation:** Git-based with semantic versioning, immutable for audit trail

## Failure Modes

### Policy Engine Unavailable
**Symptom:** Cannot evaluate policies
**Impact:** All requests blocked (fail-closed) or allowed (fail-open)
**Mitigation:**
- Fail-closed by default (deny all if policy engine down)
- Local policy cache for degraded mode
- Redundant policy engines with load balancing
**Recovery:** Restore policy engine, review decisions made during outage

### Policy Evaluation Timeout
**Symptom:** Policy check exceeds latency budget
**Impact:** Degraded user experience or blocked requests
**Mitigation:**
- Hard timeout (e.g., 500ms) triggers fail-safe action
- Cache previous decisions for identical inputs
- Async evaluation for non-critical policies
**Recovery:** Investigate slow policies, optimize or remove

### False Positive Storm
**Symptom:** Legitimate requests suddenly blocked at high rate
**Impact:** Service disruption, user complaints
**Mitigation:**
- Canary deployments for policy changes
- Automated rollback on error rate spike
- Human override capability for manual bypass
**Recovery:** Revert policy, analyze root cause, adjust thresholds

### PII Leak Despite Filtering
**Symptom:** Sensitive data appears in output despite redaction policies
**Impact:** Compliance violation, data breach
**Mitigation:**
- Multiple layers of PII detection (regex + ML)
- Post-release scanning of logs for leaked PII
- Alert on redaction failure
**Recovery:** Incident response, notify affected parties, strengthen policies

## Evaluation Criteria

An ACR-compliant Behavioral Policy Enforcement implementation should satisfy:

### Mandatory Requirements
1. **Pre-Inference Input Validation:** All inputs checked before model invocation
2. **Post-Inference Output Filtering:** All outputs checked before returning to user
3. **Action Authorization:** Tool/API calls require policy approval
4. **Deny by Default:** Unpermitted actions blocked without explicit allow
5. **Policy Logging:** Every policy decision recorded in audit trail
6. **Versioned Policies:** Policies tracked with version control

### Recommended Features
1. **Multiple Policy Types:** Supports rule-based, schema, and ML-based policies
2. **Latency SLA:** 95th percentile policy overhead <200ms
3. **False Positive Feedback:** Mechanism for users to report incorrect blocks
4. **Shadow Mode:** Ability to test policies without enforcement
5. **Policy Testing:** Automated tests validate policy behavior before deployment

### Advanced Capabilities
1. **Context-Aware Policies:** Decisions vary based on user, time, location
2. **Adaptive Policies:** Policies learn and adjust thresholds over time
3. **Explainable Decisions:** Policy violations include human-readable explanation
4. **Policy Composition:** Complex policies built from simpler primitives

## Open Research Questions

1. **Policy Language Standardization:** Is there an optimal DSL for AI governance policies?

2. **Dynamic Policy Adjustment:** How should policies automatically tune based on observed false positive/negative rates?

3. **Cross-Model Policy Portability:** Can policies written for GPT-4 work for Claude without modification?

4. **Policy Learning from Human Feedback:** Can policies be generated or refined through RLHF-style processes?

5. **Privacy-Preserving Policy Evaluation:** How to evaluate policies without exposing sensitive data to policy engine?

6. **Adversarial Policy Robustness:** How resilient are policies to deliberate evasion attempts?
